            <p class="slide-in">
                The saga of Khabib Nurmagomedov versus Conor McGregor is one of the most legendary rivalries in MMA history. 
                It all began with verbal sparring and culminated in their infamous fight at UFC 229 on October 6, 2018. 
                The buildup was intense, marked by McGregor's taunts and Khabib's calm but unyielding demeanor.

            <p class="slide-in delay">
                When the two finally clashed in the octagon, Khabib emerged victorious with a fourth-round submission, 
                solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest fighters of all time. However, the post-fight melee and 
                Khabib's leap over the cage became just as memorable as the fight itself.

            <h2 class="fade-in">From Fighter to Entrepreneur</h2>
            <p class="slide-in">
                Following his retirement from MMA in 2020 with an undefeated record, Khabib sought to channel his discipline, 
                focus, and passion into new ventures. Inspired by his love for simplicity and quality, he decided to enter 
                the food industry with a unique twist—opening his own burger shop.

            <p class="slide-in delay">
                "Every fight, I fight with precision, with respect to this game. I want my burger shop, same values," Khabib said in an interview. His vision was to create a place where people could enjoy 
                delicious, high-quality burgers with a touch of Dagestani hospitality.
